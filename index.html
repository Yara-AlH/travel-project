            <h3>Why Stockholm?</h3>
            <h2>Stockholm, the city of islands</h2>
            <p>
              The story goes that Stockholm was named 'The Venice of the North'
              for its archipelago of 14 islands, which makes it a unique and
              picturesque capital. Like Venice, Stockholm had its humble
              beginnings, and it's said that it was built on 14 islands that
              offered protection and a vibrant way of life. Although the moniker
              'The Venice of the North' didn't become widely known, the city's
              connection to its island-dotted landscape has always been at its
              heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even today, remnants of old Stockholm remain visible. Amid the
              bustling boutiques, charming waterfront caf√©s offering Swedish
              fika, and restaurants serving an array of delicious Nordic
              cuisine, you can still explore the city's archipelago, taking in
              the panoramic views, the colorful houses on the waterfront, and
              the expansive Baltic Sea on the horizon."
